# EiffelTower vs WatArun (Temper of Dawn)

Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark in Paria, France. Wat Arun or the Temple of Dawn is a famous landmark along the Chaopraya River in Bangkok, Thailand. They has similar structure, but very different architecture. This project is trying to classify pictures of these two places with convolution neural network.

Images are obtain by google images of the two places.There are about 600 pictures, which are randomly splitted into train (70%), test(20%) and valid (10%) folders. I implement the procedure I learned from fast.ai.

Skills

•	Mining images from google images 
•	Dataloader and image augmentation in GPU (fastai, py torch)
•	Transfer learning using pretrained resnet weight 
•	Achieve 93% accuracy
